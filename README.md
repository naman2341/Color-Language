# Color-Language
This is a language written entirely in colour

Let me explain:
The colors will represent a character in Octal or Hexadecimal
The langauge written in Octal could be reffered to as `ColorOct`
The langauge written in Hexademical could be reffered to as `ColorHex`

### Color Table

This is a fun project , to make a language written entirely in color

<hr>

#### Example Code
Lets consider a simple program in python

`
print("Hello World")
`

After ASCII conversion
The following code when converted to Decimal, will look something like this :

`112 114 105 110 116 40 34 72 101 108 108 111 32 87 111 114 108 100 34 41`

In `Octal`, it will look something like 

`160 162 151 156 164 050 042 110 145 154 154 157 040 127 157 162 154 144 042 051`


In `HexaDecimal`, it will look something like 

`70 72 69 6E 74 28 22 48 65 6C 6C 6F 20 57 6F 72 6C 64 22 29`


This Code, now in `ColorOct` will look like:

This Code, now in `ColorHex` will look like:
